        <h6 class="name lord ">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="speech">  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only
        thing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?
        You want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put off with any
        old-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present
        is simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a
        London dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the
        dandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.</p>
