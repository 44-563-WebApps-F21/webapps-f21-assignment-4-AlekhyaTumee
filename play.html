            terrace_</h5>
        <p> [LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
        sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]</p>

        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
        knew she would come round in the end.</p>

        <p><h6>GERALD</h6>.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
        she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
        perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
        couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.</p>
        
        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
        whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
        not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p>

        <p><h6>GERALD</h6>.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.</p>

        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
        your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
        like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
        life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
        waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
        like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
        wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
        the community.</p>    

        <p><h6>GERALD</h6>.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>

        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>

        <p><h6>GERALD</h6>.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p>

        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p>

        <p><h6>GERALD</h6>.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
            I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.</p>

        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts
            his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,
            I suppose, Gerald?</p>

        <p><h6>GERALD</h6>.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
            a mother as I have had.</p>

        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
            most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
            that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
            After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
            a hole as Wrockley, could you?</p>

        <p><h6>GERALD</h6>.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!</p>

        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is
            often curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in
            it.</p>

        <p><h6>GERALD</h6>.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.</p>

        <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good
        women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their
        interests are so petty, aren’t they?</p>
